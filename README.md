# ME 405 Lab 3

Spinning two motors at once with the magic of scheduling

## Somebody come Git her

This lab required us tune the period of our motor. We tested values manually.
We tried 70 as our period but it had too much overshoot. We tried 10 and it had
not enough. 40 was a good period so we decided to stick with it. 

The Kp is 50 as determinted to be most efficient by lab2
